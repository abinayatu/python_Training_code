Python for web development

We have many web development frameworks like
flask
django # (MVT-> Model View Template)
fastapi

"""
Using flask framework,
1. Using flask framework we can develop REST-API
2. Using flask framework we can develop Websites
3. Using flask framework we can develop Micro Services

We need to discuss on
how to use flask framework for developing REST-API

Suppose, we need to provide access to our database my_database with others/public
then
how we can provide access with others/public?

OPTION-1: We can create separate credentials like user/password
    and share.

OPTION-1 will be LIMITED. DIFFICULT to manage
"""

"""
We got 2 solutions.
1. SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
2. REST: REpresentational State Transfer

both tells how we can provide access others/public?

both tells to introduce some DOOR/GATE/INTERFACE between our-app with others
it is like
our-app/DB <--INTERFACE--> others/public

This INTERFACE is also called as APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)

both tells how to develop such interface

SOAP-API
REST-API

REST came after SOAP
- easy to implement and mange
- popular
